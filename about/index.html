<p align='center'><font face='$body-font'>&ldquo;In 2019 I 'woke up' to the state of the planet when I attended a talk about climate science and allowed the awful facts to sink down into my heart. I connected with an intense grief for the harm already done to our beautiful Earth, and I felt frightened for my own future and for the future of my young nieces. Over time I have learnt more and more about how the vast power held by a few is stopping the immediate changes that are so urgently needed. I can't quite believe how much money is still being poured into fossil fuel subsidies around the world, and that exploration for new oil is still happening, when our dependence on fossil fuels is speeding us towards total climate breakdown faster and faster. I believe in the power of sacred spaces, and in connecting ordinary people who care together. I'm excited to have the opportunity to be involved in this vigil and fast, and I trust that our voices will be heard.&rdquo;</font></p>
</br>
<p align='center'>Satya Robyn runs the Bright Earth Buddhist temple in Malvern with her husband Kaspa. She works as a psychotherapist with Internal Family Systems, and is a writer. She's been involved in activism since 2019, organising previous vigils and being involved in non-violent civil disobedience. She enjoys walking her two dogs Aiko and Ralph and eating vegan cake.</p>

<p id='Jo' align='center'><font face='fucxed' size='+2'>Jo Hindley</font></p>
<p align='center'>I resigned in 2019 - after nearly 30 years of employed practice as a midwife - when I woke up
to the intersectional Ecological, Health, Social, Political, Spiritual and Existential “Climate
Crisis” of our Time. I felt I could not continue witnessing the daily miracle of birth - my
“business (babies) as usual” - without acting now for the children, young people and adults
whose births I already held safe; for those who are potentially going to be the “last generation”
if we don’t slow and ideally turn round the juggernaut of ecological and social collapse.</p>
<p align='center'>When I first learned the truth of our dire situation I was floored by grief; I saw death
everywhere and I felt powerless in the face of the enormity of the challenge to do anything
effective to help. I have come to realise that I just need to do what I can, where I am - with
others - and not to underestimate the power of this.</p>
<p align='center'>Over the last few years I have been finding my voice; speaking, writing, and placing my body
non violently “in the way” while focussing on love and life.</p>
<p align='center'>I am a Quaker Elder and am inspired by the power of silent worship and visualisation. I will be
joining the Beyond Fossil Fuels Together Vigil and Fast to support the demand that the
Government do not grant any more fossil fuel licences, and in solidarity with the many who
are not from choice, already missing meals and starving hungry.</p>

<p id='Melanie' align='center'><font face='fucxed' size='+2'>Melanie Nazareth</font></p>
<p align='center'>“I see God in all of creation and believe that I am called to love this creation in all its richness and diversity, and if I am called to love creation that love demands that I take action to protect it. This is fundamental to my identity as a Christian, and how I also answer to the call to love my neighbour - to redress the dreadful injustice of climate change. The very first step in protecting our Earth and its most vulnerable inhabitants is for those who hold the levers of power to do the things they need to reduce our disastrous dependence on fossil fuels. Keeping vigil outside Parliament, whatever the weather, is an act of public witness, showing our leaders that this matters. For me it is an act of faith. That doesn’t mean everyone who comes to the vigil or who fasts in support has to be religious. One of my great joys is being a part of a community of people of all sorts of different perspectives and traditions who are united in their desire to safeguard our common home. Helping to build that community is my act of hope.”</p>
<p align='center'>Melanie is a family lawyer and mother of four young adults who will face the challenges of living in our climate changed world. Her childhood was spent in parts of the world already suffering the consequences of those changes. In 2021 she went from sofa laggard to backpacking footstomper in 56 days as part of a group that walked from London to COP26 in Glasgow to have a conversation with local communities about inter generational and global climate justice and to ask ordinary people to step into the power they have to bring about change.</p>

<p id='Louise' align='center'><font face='fucxed' size='+2'>Louise Scrivens</font></p>
<p align='center'>Hello I’m Louise and I’m a Quaker from Central England Area Meeting. I grew up in the Middle East in the 70’s and 80’s and witnessed firsthand the corruption and lies that the Fossil Fuel industry peddled. I saw how they diminished the humanity of those who were part of it and I saw how the pollution, back then, destroyed the local environment.</p>
<p align='center'>Fast forward to today and I have become aware of the existential crisis that confronts us as a species and of other species that call this planet home. The Ecological Climate Crisis that we are all facing could not be starker with the UN issuing a “Code Red” for humanity last year, before COP26.</p>
<p align='center'>But what has happened? Nothing that is of any proven substance in tackling the vast problem. Sir David King (was Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government and Head of the Government Office for Science from 2000 to 2007) said that what we do in the next three to four years is crucial if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change, such that our world will become largely uninhabitable.</p>
<p align='center'>I am taking part in this vigil and hunger strike to show my solidarity with anyone and everyone who is calling for the end of Fossil Fuel subsidies, new exploration and in fact any increase of fossil fuel use. This feels like the start of a conversation that we all need to have about how and how soon we end our addiction to oil.</p>
<p align='center'>Please come and join us in London outside Parliament . I look forward to seeing you there.</p>
